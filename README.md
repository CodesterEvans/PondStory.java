# PondStory.java
A story of frogs, flys, and life on the pond.

Initial commit of the Pond Project. The Pond.java file is the driver and where the story takes place. Fly and Frog are used as classes that interact in the pond.java file. Instructions are provided in a docx. 

*Skills demonstrated:*

Ability to follow instructions;

Setting the private static variables for all Frog instances from the Pond class using a public setter method from the Frog class;

Object Oriented Programming: Use of public class, private and static variables, setters, getters, various methods, classes, overloaded constructors, overloaded methods.

Problem Solving: While statement, if/else statements, counters, and conditionals used in combination to create methods that perform interactive functions between objects/instances of classes. Heavy use of print statements to evaluate code mid-code demonstrating good programming practices. 

Readability: Pond.java file has a story narrative with technical descriptions interwoven. Could use more technical details in future commit. Print statements left in the code are dirty but show thought process and can be uncommented to experiment and test efficacy of code.
